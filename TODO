- Handle compromises
  - Key revocation & distribution
  - Recalculate trust
  - Notification of trust changes?
  - Format of revocation certs
  - Allow third parties to issue "I think key X is compromised" certs?

- Handle misuse
  - Peer issuing millions of certificates

- Handle renewal
  - New keys
    - Linked to old keys
  - Upgrade certificates
    - Issue with new key but old timestamps?
  - Crypto agility (public key algo, digest algo)

- Synchronisation

- Public fides servers a la PGP?

- Link fides keys/certs with other crypto ways?
  - Standard cert for eg. linking fides key with SSH key?
  - Or fides key/cert with X.509 cert?
  - Or with plain identities like usernames, or email addresses, etc?
    - Something like PGP uids?

- What to do when exact time is not known when generating certs?
